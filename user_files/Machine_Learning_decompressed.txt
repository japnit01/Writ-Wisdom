Machine Learning  Tom M. MitchellCHAPTER  INTRODUCTION  Ever since computers were invented, we have wondered whether they might be  made to learn. If we could understand how to program them to learn-to improve  automatically with experience-the impact would be dramatic. Imagine comput ers learning from medical records which treatments are most effective for new  diseases, houses learning from experience to optimize energy costs based on the  particular usage patterns of their occupants, or personal software assistants learn ing the evolving interests of their users in order to highlight especially relevant  stories from the online morning newspaper. A successful understanding of how to  make computers learn would open up many new uses of computers and new levels  of competence and customization. And a detailed understanding of information processing algorithms for machine learning might lead to a better understanding  of human learning abilities (and disabilities) as well.  We do not yet know how to make computers learn nearly as well as people  learn. However, algorithms have been invented that are effective for certain types  of learning tasks, and a theoretical understanding of learning is beginning to  emerge. Many practical computer programs have been developed to exhibit use ful types of learning, and significant commercial applications have begun to ap pear. For problems such as speech recognition, algorithms based on machine  learning outperform all other approaches that have been attempted to date. In  the field known as data mining, machine learning algorithms are being used rou tinely to discover valuable knowledge from large commercial databases containing  equipment maintenance records, loan applications, financial transactions, medical  records, and the like. As our understanding of computers continues to mature, it
